5. Use `curl` to deploy the Application Profiles

  ```
  curl -s -k -X POST -D response_headers.txt -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -u demouser_4:1525A9C15F6520C0 https://ccm.dcloud.cisco.com/v2/jobs -d @splunk_job.json | python -m json.tool
  ```

  Again a significant amount of JSON is returned. At the very end of the returned JSON there is a URL that can be used to check the status of the job.

  "resource": "https://ccm.dcloud.cisco.com/v2/jobs/362"
